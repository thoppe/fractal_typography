## Almost everybody loves him!

@orthographic-pedant you bring light to dark places. [@jambun](https://github.com/hudmol/archivesspace/pull/786#issuecomment-144568493)
This excites me more than it should. [@Kainzo](https://github.com/MilkBowl/Vault/pull/632#issuecomment-144826246)
As much as I enjoy the view from linguistic squalor, 
I feel obliged to visit pedantry avenue occasionally. [@reggieb](https://github.com/reggieb/indulgence/pull/2)
You, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar. [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules/pull/91#issuecomment-144483181)
@orthographic-pedant thx little bot :) [@theengineear](https://github.com/plotly/postMessage-API/pull/2)
Loving this bot, @orthographic-pedant! [@pudo](https://github.com/pudo/apikit/pull/1#issuecomment-143965254)
This is... wonderful. [@p0pr0ck5](https://github.com/p0pr0ck5/FreeWAF/pull/71#event-429401497)

## _almost everybody_...

In the meantime, you're more than welcome to stuff your bot and your pedantry wherever you see fit. Personally, I'm not only rejecting such an arrogant and pretentious PR, but I'm also not fixing the typo just to annoy you. [@sole](https://github.com/thoppe/orthographic-pedant/issues/20)

Your bot is a d-bag. [@peanav](https://github.com/peanav/LESS-Presentation/pull/1)

## Lessons learned

It's easy to get 100 stars in github if you work on _other_ people's projects.

Start with a white-list, not a general spell-checker.

Language is hard, ex. French `attendent` vs `attendant`.

Don't be Eurocentric "d-bag", `Caesar` vs `Ceasar`.

Build a [honeypot](https://github.com/orthographic-pedant/honeypot) and they will come.

I've only made it through the C's...
